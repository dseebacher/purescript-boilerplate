minimal purescript boilerplate
==============================

Use npm commands to setup your environment:

```shell
npm install
```

The project uses bower, that will be installed locally. To install bower/purescript packages, use

```shell
npm run install-packages PACKAGE_NAME
```

Use other npm scripts during development, e.g.

```shell
npm run build
npm run test
npm run repl
npm run run
```
